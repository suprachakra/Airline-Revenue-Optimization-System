## IAROS: Integrated Airline Revenue Optimization System

**IAROS** is a modular, enterprise-grade product portfolio that helps airlines optimize their full revenue lifecycle—dynamically, scalably, and cost-efficiently.  
This isn't just a project. It's a **platform of platforms**—each module is a standalone product, working together as part of a composite system for airline profitability.

### 4. Architecture at a Glance

- **Microservices**: Each module is fully containerized with its own CI/CD pipeline
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes-managed deployments across environments
- **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger for full-stack monitoring
- **Compliance**: GDPR, IATA NDC, internal audit pipelines
- **Interoperability**: REST + GraphQL APIs, OpenAPI specs, modular schemas

---

### 5. Cross-Cutting Capabilities

- **Security & Auth**: OAuth2, JWT, role-based access across services
- **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, caching, graceful degradation paths
- **Fallback Logic**: Across pricing, offers, forecasting, P2P
- **Governance**: Config versioning, audit logs, standardized model validation
- **Cost-to-Revenue Loop**: P2P data → Forecasting → Pricing → Offers
