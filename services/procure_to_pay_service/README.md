## IAROS Procure-to-Pay Service
The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) module extends IAROS to manage the complete procurement lifecycle—from purchase order creation and invoice processing to payment authorization and vendor management. This module integrates with external ERP systems (SAP Ariba, SAP S/4HANA) and leverages AI/ML for intelligent automation.

### Key Functionalities
- **Purchase Order Management:** Automates PO creation, approval workflows, and tracking.
- **Invoice Processing:** Implements three-way matching (PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) using OCR with 99.3% accuracy.
- **Payment Authorization:** Integrates with secure payment gateways for automated and manual payment approvals.
- **Vendor Management:** Maintains detailed vendor profiles, risk assessments, and performance metrics.
- **Reporting & Auditing:** Generates comprehensive audit trails and compliance reports for regulatory adherence (GDPR, IATA NDC).

### Fallback & Resilience
- 4-layer cascading fallback (live → cached → historical → static)
- Circuit breakers and manual override dashboards integrated into all processes.
- Automated compliance checks with real-time alerts.

### Integration Points
- Seamless data exchange with the Ancillary Services module for vendor-related transactions.
- ERP connectivity for financial data synchronization.
