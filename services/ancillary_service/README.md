## Ancillary Service Module
This module manages over 110 ancillary offerings using both legacy static and reinforcement learningâ€“based dynamic bundling. It provides personalized ancillary bundles through advanced algorithms and integrates with loyalty systems. Robust fallback mechanisms ensure that, in the event of external API failures, default bundles are served automatically.
