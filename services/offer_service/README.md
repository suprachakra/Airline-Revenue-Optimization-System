## Offer Management Service for IAROS
This module aggregates inputs from pricing, forecasting, ancillary, and loyalty services to compose final offers. It applies personalized adjustments (e.g., group discounts, loyalty-based promotions) and enforces strict fallback strategies to ensure continuity if any input module fails.

### Key Features
- **Data Aggregation:** Combines outputs from multiple services.
- **Personalization:** Applies loyalty and customer segmentation adjustments.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Uses cached offers if any service is unavailable.
- **Robust Integration:** Exposes REST and GraphQL endpoints for offer distribution.
