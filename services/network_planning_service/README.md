## Network Planning Core v3.1
The Network Planning Service optimizes flight scheduling, inventory reallocation, and codeshare synchronization. It ingests real‑time data from external scheduling APIs and partner systems, applies advanced simulation models (e.g., Monte Carlo methods), and enforces fallback strategies if data delays or discrepancies occur.

### Key Capabilities
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Real‑time flight schedule optimization with automated retries.
- **Inventory Reallocation:** AI‑driven seat redistribution across routes.
- **Codeshare Integration:** Automated synchronization with partner airlines via secure API calls.
- **Fallback Strategies:**  
  - If external scheduling data is delayed (>15 minutes stale), fallback to FAA ASDI feed.
  - If codeshare data discrepancy exceeds 5%, revert to the last valid cached schedule.

### Compliance Assurance
- Adheres to IATA SSIM Standards and FAA Part 121 rules.
- GDPR‑compliant passenger data handling.
