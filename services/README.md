# IAROS Services - Microservices Architecture

## 📊 Overview

This directory contains all **15 core microservices** that comprise the IAROS (Intelligent Airline Revenue Optimization System) platform. Each service is designed as an independent, scalable component that handles specific business capabilities while maintaining loose coupling and high cohesion.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Microservices Design Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns a specific business domain
- **Database per Service**: Independent data stores for autonomy
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized entry point for all client requests
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Resilience against cascading failures
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication via events

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.19+ for high-performance backend services
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis based on use case
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for observability
