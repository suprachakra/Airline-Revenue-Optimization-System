## Synthetic Monitoring for IAROS
This document outlines the synthetic monitoring strategy for IAROS. Canary tests and synthetic transactions are executed to validate:
- API response times and fallback activations.
- Data consistency and quality across services.
- Real-time compliance of pricing decisions.

### Key Scenarios
- **API Latency Checks:** Every 30 seconds to monitor response times.
- **Fallback Activation:** Validate that fallback paths trigger under simulated failures.
- **Compliance Audits:** Automated scripts simulate data anomalies to verify GDPR and IATA checks.

### Tools and Integration
- Prometheus and Grafana for metric collection and alerting.
- Custom synthetic transaction scripts integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
