## Gradual Rollout Strategy
This document outlines our phased deployment strategy using feature toggles and A/B testing to ensure seamless rollouts with minimal risk.

### Rollout Phases
1. **Pilot Phase:** Enable feature for 5% of users.
2. **Expansion Phase:** Increase rollout incrementally by 5% after validating key metrics (conversion, performance).
3. **Full Deployment:** Feature enabled for 100% of users after thorough testing and monitoring.

### Versioning & Rollback
- All feature toggles are version-controlled.
- Immediate rollback procedures are in place if critical issues are detected.
