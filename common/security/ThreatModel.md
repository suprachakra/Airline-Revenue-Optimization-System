## STRIDE-Based Threat Model for IAROS
This document provides a comprehensive STRIDE threat analysis for IAROS. It addresses:
- **Spoofing:** Mitigated via mutual TLS and robust JWT validation.
- **Tampering:** Prevented by cryptographic hash verification and secure secret management.
- **Repudiation:** Mitigated with immutable audit trails and full logging.
- **Information Disclosure:** Ensured via AES-256 encryption and strict access controls.
- **Denial of Service:** Addressed with adaptive circuit breakers and rate limiting.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Managed through RBAC and continuous vulnerability scanning.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement dynamic key rotation and secure secret storage using VaultClient.
- Enforce strict logging with SIEM integration.
- Regularly run automated vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
