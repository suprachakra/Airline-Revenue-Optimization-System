## Internal API Documentation
This document details the internal REST and GraphQL APIs used within IAROS. It covers endpoints for service-to-service communication, error handling strategies, and fallback mechanisms.

### Key Sections:
- **Dynamic Pricing API**: Endpoints for calculating real-time fares.
- **Forecasting API**: Endpoints for retrieving predictive models and triggers for retraining.

- **Offer Management API**: Aggregates data from multiple modules for final offer composition.

Each API includes:
