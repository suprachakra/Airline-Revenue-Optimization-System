## Continuous Regression Testing for IAROS
*Integrated into our CI/CD pipelines to safeguard system stability*

### 1. Critical Regression Paths
- **Pricing Engine → Ancillary Bundling:** Ensure no disruption in revenue optimization.
- **Forecasting → Network Optimization:** Validate that changes do not impact demand predictions.
- **Offer Composition → NDC Distribution:** Confirm seamless data aggregation and offer generation.

### 2. Automated Regression Validation
- **Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Azure Pipelines.
- **Process:**  
  - Regression tests run automatically on every merge request.
  - Tests must achieve 100% pass rate on critical paths before deployment.
  
```yaml
# Example .gitlab-ci.yml snippet
regression_test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest tests/regression --junitxml=report.xml
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
  allow_failure: false
```

### 3. Fallback & Recovery
- **Rollback Mechanism:**
  - Immediate automated rollback to the last stable release if regression tests fail.

- **Alerting:**
  - Automated alerts notify the QA and engineering teams for further investigation.

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
- **Post-Deployment:**
  - Ongoing monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana ensures no regressions occur in production.

This regression testing framework ensures that IAROS remains robust with every code change, with fully automated safeguards that prevent disruptions to existing functionalities.
