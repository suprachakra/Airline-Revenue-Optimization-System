## Security Testing for IAROS
*Ensuring Zero Critical Vulnerabilities and Compliance with SOC2 and Regulatory Standards*

### 1. Penetration Testing
- **Objective:** Identify and remediate vulnerabilities before exploitation.
- **Process:**  
  - Regular automated and manual penetration tests.
  - Quarterly external security audits.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Nessus.
- **Fallback:**  
  - If a critical vulnerability is detected, automated patching and immediate rollback via CI/CD are triggered.

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning
- **Automated Scans:**  
  - Continuous scans using Snyk and Qualys integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Frequency:** Daily scans with automated alerting.
  
### 3. Secret and API Security
- **Secret Scanning:**  
  - Real-time scanning with GitGuardian to detect exposed credentials.
- **API Security:**  
  - API Gateway enforced with Web Application Firewall (WAF) and Istio mTLS.
- **Fallback:**  
  - Auto-revoke keys and block vulnerable endpoints if anomalies are detected.

### 4. Compliance Testing
- **Integration:**  
  - Automated tests for GDPR, IATA NDC Level 4, and CORSIA compliance.
- **Fallback:**  
  - Immediate fallback to previous secure configurations if compliance tests fail.
  
This security testing framework is designed to proactively identify, remediate, and prevent vulnerabilities, ensuring a robust, secure, and compliant IAROS environment without any need for manual intervention.
