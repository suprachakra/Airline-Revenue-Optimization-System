## Testing Strategy 
*Validated Against IATA NDC, GDPR, and Airline-Specific SLAs*

### 1. Test Types & Coverage

| **Test Type**      | **Scope**                               | **Tools/Metrics**                                          | **Fallback Protocol**                                |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Unit Tests**     | Validate individual functions (e.g., pricing algorithms, model training) | Pytest/Go Testing (100% code coverage, target 95% pass rate) | Auto-trigger rollback; alert via SIEM if coverage falls below threshold. |
| **Integration Tests** | Verify communication between microservices (e.g., Pricing, Ancillary, Forecasting) | Postman, SoapUI; success rate target ≥98%                 | Automated rollback to last known good configuration; triggered by CI/CD pipeline failures. |
| **End-to-End Tests**   | Simulate full user journeys from data ingestion to offer generation | Selenium, Cypress; performance, latency, and accuracy metrics | Simulated data feed fallback; auto-triggered Incident Response if E2E tests fail. |
| **Regression Tests**   | Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality  | Automated regression suite integrated into CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab CI) | Immediate rollback to last stable release; continuous automated monitoring. |
| **Chaos & Performance Tests** | Stress system under simulated failures (load, latency, outages) | Gremlin, k6, JMeter; measure auto-scaling and fallback activations | Preconfigured fallback scenarios (cached responses, manual override simulation) activated automatically. |

### 2. Resolution Playbook
#### Scenario: Geo‑Fencing API Failure
1. **Auto‑Fallback:** Switch to static regional fares immediately.
2. **Cache Revalidation:** Trigger an AWS Lambda function to revalidate and refresh cache.
3. **Postmortem Analysis:** Automated incident logging in Jira Service Management with a target resolution within 1 hour.

### 3. SAFe & Agile Alignment
- **PI Planning & ART Demos:** Test results are reviewed during Program Increment (PI) planning and ART demos.
- **Inspect & Adapt:** Regular retrospective meetings and automated metrics inform continuous improvement.
- **WSJF Prioritization:** Test cases are prioritized based on business value and risk.

### 4. Automated Monitoring & Feedback
- Continuous integration ensures tests run on every commit.
- Real-time alerts via SIEM, Slack, and PagerDuty guarantee rapid, automated responses to failures.
- Automated health checks trigger immediate fallbacks without manual intervention.
