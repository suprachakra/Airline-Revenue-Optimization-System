# Epics and Strategic Alignment

This document outlines the major epics driving the Integrated Airline Revenue Optimization System (IAROS). Each epic is aligned with specific strategic objectives (OKRs), detailing key features, risks with mitigation strategies, and implementation notes. Our current six epics comprehensively cover dynamic pricing, ancillary services, forecasting, network optimization, offer management, and operational & security excellence.
