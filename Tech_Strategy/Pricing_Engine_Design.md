## Pricing Engine Design

The Dynamic Pricing Engine is the heart of our revenue optimization portfolio. It is responsible for computing real‑time fare adjustments across 142 validated scenarios. These scenarios cover diverse use cases such as geo‑fencing, corporate contract pricing, and event‑driven adjustments. The engine combines machine learning outputs with rule‑based logic, ensuring that if any data or integration failure occurs, robust fallback mechanisms automatically kick in.

### 1.1 Dynamic Pricing Scenarios

| **Scenario Category**                         | **Description**                                                                                         | **Examples**                                                                                                        | **Fallback Strategy**                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geo‑Fencing Adjustments (30 Scenarios)**    | Adjust fares based on the customer’s geographical location.                                           | - India-GCC routes receive a 15% discount. <br> - European customers see standard pricing unless flagged.            | Default to a 5% discount if geo‑IP data is unavailable or erroneous.   |
| **Corporate Contract Pricing (20 Scenarios)** | Adjust fares based on corporate agreements and floating discount factors (e.g., Brent Crude sensitivity). | - Contracts with a base discount of 10% adjusted by a sensitivity factor of 0.02 per $ change in Brent.                | Use the last known good corporate rate if live market data is delayed.   |
| **Event‑Driven Adjustments (40 Scenarios)**   | Respond to external events such as competitor flash sales or sudden demand spikes.                      | - Trigger a surge multiplier when competitor prices drop sharply. <br> - Apply a discount during major travel events.   | Revert to historical average adjustments if real‑time event data fails.  |
| **Seasonal & Temporal Pricing (30 Scenarios)**| Adjust fares based on seasonal demand patterns and time-of-day variations.                               | - Increased pricing during peak holiday seasons. <br> - Off‑peak discounts during low‑demand hours.                   | Utilize pre‑calculated seasonal adjustment tables when dynamic data is unavailable. |
| **Customer Segmentation Adjustments (22 Scenarios)** | Tailor pricing based on customer segmentation (e.g., loyalty tier, booking channel).                   | - Premium customers receive a loyalty bonus discount. <br> - Budget segments trigger competitive pricing.             | Apply standard pricing rules if segmentation data is missing.           |

### 1.2 Implementation Details

#### **Key Functions and Pseudocode:**

#### Geo‑Fencing Function
```go
// GetGeoDiscount returns a discount percentage based on the provided geo-IP.
func GetGeoDiscount(geoIP string) float64 {
    switch geoIP {
    case "IN":
        return 0.15 // 15% discount for India-GCC routes
    case "AE", "QA":
        return 0.0  // Full fare for domestic routes
    default:
        return 0.05 // Default 5% discount
    }
}
```
*Fallback:* If `geoIP` is empty or unrecognized, return 0.05 and log the anomaly for further investigation.

#### Corporate Discount Calculation
```go
// CorporateDiscount holds the parameters for calculating a corporate discount.
type CorporateDiscount struct {
    BaseRate         float64  // Initial discount rate
    BrentSensitivity float64  // Sensitivity factor per $1 change in Brent Crude
}

// CurrentRate computes the dynamic discount rate.
func (d CorporateDiscount) CurrentRate(currentBrent float64) float64 {
    calculatedRate := d.BaseRate + (currentBrent * d.BrentSensitivity)
    // Cap the discount rate at 25% for compliance
    if calculatedRate > 0.25 {
        return 0.25
    }
    return calculatedRate
}
```
*Fallback:* If currentBrent is unavailable, use the last known good value from a secure cache.

#### Event-Driven Pricing
```go
// AdjustPriceForEvent applies a surge multiplier if an event is detected.
func AdjustPriceForEvent(baseFare float64, eventTriggered bool, surgeFactor float64) float64 {
    if eventTriggered {
        return baseFare * (1 + surgeFactor)
    }
    return baseFare
}
```
*Fallback:* If event data is missing, use historical surge factors stored in a configuration file.

### 1.3 Testing and Risk Mitigation

- **Testing:**  
  All 142 scenarios are comprehensively covered in `pricing_test.go` with both unit and integration tests.
- **Risk Mitigation:**  
  - **Circuit Breakers:** Implemented via Hystrix (or similar) to isolate failures.
  - **Automated Fallbacks:** If any pricing call fails, fallback routines ensure a default price is returned.
  - **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time performance is tracked via Prometheus and Grafana, with alerts if pricing latency exceeds 200ms.

---

### 1.4 Summary
The Pricing Engine is engineered to deliver dynamic, real-time fare optimization through 142 robust scenarios. Every function includes fallback paths to ensure no disruption in revenue, even when data is delayed or integrations fail. This design minimizes manual intervention and aligns with our strategic objectives of revenue uplift and operational efficiency.
