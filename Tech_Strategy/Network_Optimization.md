# Network Optimization
The network optimization module enhances flight scheduling, inventory allocation, and codeshare synchronization by integrating real-time revenue data. It leverages advanced simulation models to provide actionable insights, ensuring operational efficiency and cost savings.

## Key Components

### 1. A380 Rotation Algorithm
- **Purpose:**  
  Optimize aircraft utilization for high-capacity flights.
- **Implementation:**
```python
# File: services/network_service/src/Scheduler.py
def optimize_a380():
    current_schedule = get_current_schedule()
    best_score = evaluate_schedule(current_schedule)
    for i in range(1000):  # Monte Carlo simulation
        swap = monte_carlo_search(current_schedule)
        score = evaluate_schedule(swap)
        if score > best_score:
            best_score = score
            current_schedule = swap
    return current_schedule
```
- **Fallback:**  
  If simulation data is stale (e.g., ACARS data >15 min old), revert to FAA ASDI feed for schedule updates.

### 2. Real-Time Inventory Reallocation
- **Purpose:**  
  Adjust seat inventory dynamically based on real-time demand.
- **Implementation:**  
  Integrates signals from the dynamic pricing and forecasting modules to reallocate seats.
- **Fallback:**  
  Uses historical allocation patterns if live data is unavailable or inconsistent.

### 3. Codeshare Synchronization
- **Purpose:**  
  Ensure accurate and consistent flight data with partner airlines.
- **Implementation:**  
  Utilizes secure APIs with robust retry logic.
- **Fallback:**  
  Maintains the last known configuration if synchronization fails beyond a threshold (e.g., >5% discrepancy).

## Handling External Data Delays
- **Monitoring:**  
  Alerts are configured in our observability stack to notify if external data (e.g., from Sabre or ACARS) is delayed.
- **Fallback Triggers:**  
  If live data falls below a quality threshold, the system automatically switches to a fallback data source.

*This module is critical for operational savings (e.g., 12% fuel savings on transatlantic routes) and ensures that network planning remains agile even under adverse conditions.*
