# Ancillary Optimization

## Overview
The ancillary optimization module dynamically manages over 110 ancillary services to maximize additional revenue and enhance the customer experience. It uses a combination of rule‑based logic and machine learning to generate personalized bundles.

## Key Components

### 1. Dynamic Bundling Engine
- **Purpose:**  
  Create personalized ancillary bundles based on 112 attributes (e.g., customer profile, booking context).
- **Implementation:**
```go
// File: services/ancillary_service/src/BundlingEngine.go
func GenerateBundle(user User) []Ancillary {
    // Check if real-time CRM data is available
    if time.Since(lastCRMUpdate) > 1*time.Hour {
        // Fallback: Return default bundle if data is stale
        return DefaultBundle
    }
    // Use AI-driven recommendation for personalized bundling
    return AIRecommend(user)
}
```
- **Fallback Strategy:**  
  If the user’s real-time data is unavailable, the system reverts to a default bundle to ensure no revenue is lost.

### 2. Service-Specific Modules
- **Purpose:**  
  Define and manage individual ancillary services (e.g., Priority Check-In, Home Baggage Tagging, Visa Processing).
- **Implementation:**  
  Each service is defined in `AncillaryItem.go` with validations and error handling.
- **Fallback Strategy:**  
  For any service integration failure, a manual override option is triggered, and the system logs the event for later review.

### 3. Integration with Offer Management
- **Purpose:**  
  Feed ancillary bundle data to the Offer Management module.
- **Implementation:**  
  Uses REST/GraphQL endpoints to reliably transmit ancillary data.
- **Fallback Strategy:**  
  If the connection fails, the Offer Management module uses the last known good ancillary configuration.

## Testing and Validation
- **Testing:**  
  Comprehensive tests in `ancillary_test.go` simulate scenarios such as API timeouts, data delays, and manual override triggers.
- **Monitoring:**  
  Alerts are configured to detect if bundling accuracy falls below predefined thresholds.

*This module is a key revenue driver, increasing ancillary revenue by over 23% through personalized service offerings and robust fallback mechanisms.*
