## System Integrations

IAROS integrates with multiple external systems to ensure a seamless flow of data and operational consistency. Each integration point is designed with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. Passenger Service System (PSS)
- **Integration:** Amadeus Alt√©a API
- **Purpose:** Synchronize booking and inventory data.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - **Retry Logic:** Retries with exponential backoff on failure.
  - **Fallback:** Uses cached inventory data if real-time data retrieval fails.
- **Monitoring:** Alerts configured in Prometheus if synchronization latency exceeds 500ms.

#### 2. Loyalty Systems
- **Integration:** Secure GraphQL API for loyalty data (e.g., Etihad Guest)
- **Purpose:** Retrieve customer profiles, loyalty tiers, and reward points.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - **Fallback:** Applies a default loyalty tier if the API is unresponsive.
  - **Security:** Ensures OAuth2-based authentication.
- **Monitoring:** Logs and alerts for token expiration and API errors.

#### 3. Distribution Channels (ATPCO, NDC)
- **Integration:** RESTful APIs conforming to OpenAPI v3 specifications.
- **Purpose:** Distribute dynamic offers across multiple channels.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - **Data Validation:** Ensures data integrity before transmission.
  - **Fallback:** Reverts to static fare models if dynamic pricing data is unavailable.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time dashboard displays error rates and fallback activations.

#### 4. External Market Data Providers
- **Integration:** REST APIs providing competitor pricing and market trends.
- **Purpose:** Inform dynamic pricing adjustments in real time.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - **Circuit Breakers:** Isolate failure if market data delays occur.
  - **Fallback:** Uses historical market data to approximate current conditions.
- **Monitoring:** Automated alerts trigger if data freshness falls below a defined threshold.

## Summary
Every integration point in IAROS is meticulously designed to handle failures gracefully. Detailed error handling, retry logic, and fallback strategies ensure that even if one system experiences issues, overall operations continue uninterrupted.
