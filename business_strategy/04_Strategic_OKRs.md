| **OKR ID** | **Objective**                     | **Key Results**                                                                                                                                      | **Notes/Implementation Plan**                                                                                           |
|------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OKR-1      | Dynamic Pricing Leadership        | - Implement 142 pricing scenarios across all routes by Q3 2025.<br>- Achieve <200ms API response for pricing service (95th percentile).              | Fallback: Deploy manual override dashboard; use circuit breakers and caching mechanisms.                              |
| OKR-2      | Ancillary Revenue Dominance       | - Launch 110+ personalized ancillary bundles with a 23% attach rate.<br>- Increase ancillary revenue from $21/pax to $28/pax by 2026.               | Fallback: Default bundles for legacy channels; implement robust monitoring and real-time alerts for integration failures.|
| OKR-3      | Forecasting Precision             | - Attain forecast accuracy of 90%+ on all 83 models.<br>- Reduce forecast error (MAPE) by 20% across all modules by end of FY2025.                    | Contingency: Trigger automatic retraining if forecast accuracy drops; include human-in-the-loop validation during anomalies.|
| OKR-4      | Network Planning Optimization     | - Achieve 12% fuel savings on transatlantic routes via optimized scheduling.<br>- Reduce manual scheduling adjustments by 30% by Q4 2025.              | Fallback: Use simulation tools to recommend adjustments; manual intervention supported via a dedicated dashboard.         |
| OKR-5      | Operational & Security Excellence | - Maintain 99.9% uptime across all services.<br>- Achieve full compliance with IATA NDC Level 4 and GDPR by Q2 2025.<br>- Complete automated regression tests. | Risk Mitigation: Implement multi-region auto-scaling; enforce strict CI/CD with pre-deployment health checks and security scans.|

### Implementation Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (Q1-Q2 2025):**  
  Roll out the core dynamic pricing and forecasting modules with integrated fallback mechanisms.  
  *Milestones:* 100% scenario coverage, initial model retraining, basic dashboard deployment.
  
- **Phase 2 (Q3 2025):**  
  Integrate ancillary services and network planning modules, ensuring seamless data flow and fallback support.  
  *Milestones:* 110+ ancillary bundles live, 12% fuel saving pilot test.
  
- **Phase 3 (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026):**  
  Full portfolio integration with offer management, enhanced security protocols, and continuous compliance verification.  
  *Milestones:* 6-week full module deployment, complete CI/CD automation, and industry-leading forecast accuracy.
