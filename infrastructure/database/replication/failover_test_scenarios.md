## Database Failover Test Scenarios

This document details test scenarios for verifying database replication and failover capabilities:
1. Simulated primary database outage.
2. Network latency and packet loss impact on replication.
3. Verification of automated switchover and data consistency.
4. Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) measurements.
