## Resharding Procedures for Pricing Data

This document outlines detailed procedures for rebalancing database shards:
1. Pre-resharding analysis (data volume, growth trends).
2. Locking mechanisms to prevent writes during resharding.
3. Automated migration of data to new shards.
4. Validation of data integrity post-resharding.
5. Rollback procedures if resharding fails.
