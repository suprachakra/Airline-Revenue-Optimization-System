## Degraded Mode Operations Guidelines

When operating in degraded mode due to partial outages:
1. Only critical services remain active.
2. Non-essential functionality is disabled.
3. Manual overrides available via dedicated admin dashboards.
4. Monitor fallback alerts continuously.
5. Follow instructions in the incident response protocol for gradual recovery.
