## Data Governance for IAROS
*Ensuring data quality, privacy, and compliance (GDPR, CCPA, IATA) across the system*

### 1. Data Quality & Privacy Policies
- **Data Quality:**  
  - Automated data validation using ETL pipelines and anomaly detection (dbt tests, SQL validations).
  - Regular audits to supplement automated checks.
- **Privacy:**  
  - Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256.
  - Use roleâ€‘based access controls (RBAC) and PII masking.
  
### 2. Audit Logging & Traceability
- **Centralized Logging:**  
  - Immutable logs stored in versioned S3 buckets.
  - Integration with SIEM and AWS CloudTrail.
- **Data Lineage:**  
  - Use AWS Lake Formation and OpenLineage to track data flow.
  
### 3. Fallback Strategies & Automated Checks
- **Fallback:**  
  - In case of data quality issues, the system reverts to the last validated snapshot.
  - Nightly automated audits trigger alerts if discrepancies exceed thresholds.

### 4. Documentation & Training
- **Policies:**  
  - Comprehensive internal data governance policies available via the intranet.
- **Training:**  
  - Regular training sessions for all teams on data handling, privacy, and compliance.
  
*This data governance framework ensures that IAROS maintains high data quality and privacy standards automatically, with robust, continuous monitoring and fallback mechanisms.*
