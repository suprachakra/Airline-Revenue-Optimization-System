## A/B Testing Plan

This document outlines our comprehensive strategy for conducting controlled experiments (A/B testing) to validate new features, optimize system performance, and ensure customer experience improvements. The plan leverages automated multi-armed bandit techniques, robust rollback mechanisms, and continuous monitoring, fully aligned with SAFe Agile practices (PI Planning, ART demos, Inspect & Adapt).

---

### 1. Testing Strategy

- **Objective:** Validate new features (UI enhancements, dynamic pricing algorithms, personalization modules) without disrupting overall system stability.
- **Design:**  
  - Randomized controlled experiments with traffic splitting between control and variant groups.
  - Multi-armed bandit approaches for dynamic allocation of traffic to the best-performing variant.
- **Metrics:**  
  - Conversion rate, user engagement, NPS/CSAT, revenue per offer.
  - Statistical significance measured using p-values (target: p < 0.05) and confidence intervals.
- **Automated Rollbacks:**  
  - If the variant underperforms by >10% relative to the control, an automated rollback is triggered.
  - Integration into CI/CD pipelines ensures immediate reversion to the last stable release if performance thresholds are not met.

### 2. Rollout Criteria & Automated Rollbacks

| **Metric**          | **Threshold**                      | **Rollback Trigger**                             |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Conversion Rate     | Variant < Control by >10%          | Automated rollback via CI/CD pipelines           |
| Engagement Metrics  | NPS/CSAT drop by >15%              | Disable variant and revert to control           |
| Error Rates         | Critical error rate > defined limit| Immediate rollback and alert via PagerDuty/SIEM  |

**Example (Python Pseudocode):**

```python
# File: analytics/ab_test.py
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

def validate_ab_test(control, variant):
    p_value = ttest_ind(control, variant).pvalue
    if p_value > 0.05 or (mean(variant) < mean(control) * 0.9):
        trigger_rollback("Variant underperformance or insufficient significance")
```

### 3. Documentation & Reporting
- **Test Plans:**  
  - Detailed A/B test plans with hypotheses, metrics, and expected outcomes.
- **Automated Reports:**  
  - Generate weekly and monthly A/B testing reports integrated into our BI dashboards.
  - Continuous improvement cycles feed results into PI Planning and ART retrospectives.

### 4. SAFe Alignment
- **PI Planning & ART Demos:**  
  - Test results are reviewed during Program Increment planning and ART demos.
- **Inspect & Adapt:**  
  - Regular retrospectives and automated feedback loops ensure that any underperforming feature is quickly addressed.

*This A/B testing strategy ensures that every new feature is rigorously validated and that automated rollback mechanisms protect system stability, ensuring a seamless user experience.*
