## A/B Testing Plan for IAROS
*Controlled feature rollouts using multi-armed bandit algorithms and automated rollback strategies*

### 1. Testing Strategy
- **Objective:**  
  Validate new features (UI enhancements, personalization algorithms) without impacting overall system stability.
- **Design:**  
  - Randomized controlled experiments with traffic splitting.
  - Use of multi-armed bandit approaches for dynamic allocation of traffic.
- **Metrics:**  
  - Conversion rates, user engagement, NPS/CSAT.
  - Statistical significance with p-values and confidence intervals.

### 2. Rollout Criteria & Automated Rollbacks
| **Metric**          | **Threshold**          | **Rollback Trigger**                    |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Conversion Rate     | Î” < target improvement | Auto-disable feature if performance drops >10% below control |
| Error Rates         | > Critical threshold   | Immediate rollback via CI/CD pipelines  |

**Example (Python):**
```python
# File: analytics/ab_test.py
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

def validate_results(control, variant):
    p_value = ttest_ind(control, variant).pvalue
    if p_value > 0.05:
        trigger_rollback("insufficient_significance")
```

### 3. Documentation & Reporting
- **Test Plans:**  
  - Detailed A/B test plans with hypotheses, metrics, and expected outcomes.
- **Automated Reports:**  
  - Generate reports and dashboards summarizing test results for continuous improvement.

*This A/B testing strategy ensures that every new feature is rigorously validated and that automated rollback mechanisms protect system stability, ensuring a seamless user experience.*
